# PROGRESS.md — Stonewake status

> Claude: keep this file current. Update at every milestone gate and before any stop.
> A fresh session should be able to resume from this file + CLAUDE.md alone.

## Current state
- **Milestone:** M2 complete — gates A11, A2, A3 green
- **Last session:** 2026-08-24
- **Next action:** M3 — the Sundering polish + first full loop in the browser (gate A6)

## Milestone checklist
- [x] M0 — sim skeleton + headless CLI (gate A11)
- [x] M1 — Act I tower-defense core (gate A2)
- [x] M2 — Act II survivors core (gate A3)
- [ ] M3 — the Sundering, first full loop (gate A6)
- [ ] M4 — full content pass (gates A4, A5)
- [ ] M5 — meta layer: relics, tree, classes, tiers (gate A8)
- [ ] M6 — final boss, Awakenings, Rifts
- [ ] M7 — balance sweeps green (A1–A9)
- [ ] M8 — feel + ship (gate A10)

## Layout
```
data/              all tuning + content as JSON (schema-validated in src/sim/content.ts)
src/sim/           deterministic core: no DOM, no Math.random, no Date.now, no native trig
src/bots/          scripted headless policies (idle | turtle | kite | hybrid | no-move)
src/render/        canvas renderer (reads sim state only)
src/ui/            browser entry point + HUD
src/meta/          account meta: Ember, Constellation, stash, quests, save/load
tools/sim.ts       headless CLI -> JSON report
tools/sweep.ts     in-process balance sweeps (fast; use this for tuning)
tools/gen-tree.mjs regenerates data/tree.json (120-node Constellation)
tests/             vitest; acceptance tests are named aNN-*.test.ts
```

## M0 — done
- Vite + TS + Vitest + Zod scaffold; `npm test`, `npm run sim`, `npm run build` wired.
- Seeded RNG with the five named streams (`waves/spawns/drops/offers/ai`), mulberry32 core.
- Deterministic math module (`dsin`/`dcos`/`datan2`) so no native trig enters the sim.
- 36×20 Bastion Vale grid; integer-cost Dijkstra flow fields (ground + ghost);
  path-guarantee check (`wouldBlockPath`) with state restore.
- World/entity model, spatial hash, fixed 60 Hz phase machine, Warden movement +
  dash + Act I manual attack, wave spawning, Core damage/defeat, end-state hashing.
- All data files authored and cross-validated at load.
- **Gate A11 green**: 100 seeds × (run, replay) produce identical end-state hashes.

## M1 — done
- Combat primitives shared by both acts: projectiles, AoE, cones, pierce lines,
  chains, ground areas, first-target selection, cluster/line direction search.
- All 10 towers, data-driven attack kinds (single/pierce/cone/aura/chain/lob/poison),
  three tiers on the SPEC cost curve, Beacon auras, Harvest Sprout income.
- Build/upgrade/sell commands enforcing tile legality, build range, gold, class
  locks and the path-guarantee rule; early wave call pays 2 gold per second skipped.
- Enemy traits live: armour, front shields, healers, buffers, splitters, bombers,
  burrowers, phasing wraiths, chargers, stomps, ranged spitters, fire trails.
- Bot policies with lane-adjacent build-site ranking that avoids the Sundering
  blast pocket.
- **Gate A2 green**: idle play loses the Core on wave 3–4 across 25 seeds.

## M2 — done
- Soul weapons: all 8 kinds (single / pierce / cone / nova / chain / lob / trail)
  with 6-level tracks, the SPEC 4.1 inheritance formula, and the 3 Awakenings.
- Act II spawn director: continuous budget accrual, per-minute weight table,
  elites, Rift bursts, alive cap, Warden-Eater cue at 10:00.
- XP gems with fade + cap, the 5n+n² level curve, 1-of-3 offers with a reroll,
  boons applied through the shared stat pipeline.
- The Sundering: petrification, Heartstone pocket, guaranteed approach lanes,
  spire linking, terrain residuals, wall/beacon passives, soul binding.
- Canvas renderer, DOM HUD, browser entry point; `npm run build` produces a
  playable bundle.
- Meta module (Ember, Constellation allocation, stash, quests, save/load).
- Warden base stats moved out of code into `data/warden.json`.
- **Gate A3 green**: a Warden that never moves always dies (median 119 s) and
  never reaches the boss; the same build survives far longer when it moves.

### Balance defects found and fixed during M2
- Act II spawn points sat inside the impassable border ring, so nothing moved.
- Enemy separation formed a shell that stopped the horde ever touching the Warden.
- Uncollected XP gems grew without bound (16k+ in a long run).
- Piercing Bolt was 86% of all damage; blast damage had the same flaw. Both now
  fall off per additional target — the mechanism A5 will lean on.
- Act II fodder was 7× weaker than the wave-10 enemies just fought: the ×0.6
  overlay now applies to the statline Act I ended on, not the wave-1 roster.
- Weapon ranges of 6–12 tiles made Nightfall a shooting gallery; cut to
  survivors scale so the horde closes.
- The Beacon aura cache lived at module scope and leaked between worlds.

## Known issues / skipped tests
- `tests/a3-movement-mandatory.test.ts` skips **every seed is dead by 3:00**.
  Act II survival is bimodal: a stationary Warden that survives the opening
  minutes snowballs on XP, and 2–3 seeds in 12 last past 3:00. The median is
  119 s and the aggregate gap versus moving play is large, so A3 passes on the
  median. Owned by **M7 balance**.
- Act II outcomes are swingy for the `hybrid` bot (win rate ~50% at T1). The M7
  pass should flatten this before A1 and A8 are judged.

## Session log (newest first)
- 2026-08-24 — M2: Act II Nightfall complete, gate A3 green. Renderer, HUD and
  browser loop in place; production build works. Next: M3.

- 2026-08-24 — Scaffolded the project, authored `/data`, built the M0 sim
  skeleton. A11 passing.
